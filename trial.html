	<p>Hi! My name is Jenel Justo.</p>
	<p>I go by Jenel, Nel, or Juju.</p>
	<p>I love CMSC 12 because it was my first comsci course and that was where I learned to enjoy coding.</p>
	<p>STS 1 is my favorite GE as of now because of the fun activities we had in class.</p>
	<p>Python is <3 <3. It is easier to understand and to write with.</p>
	<p>Sinigang Supremacy Squad! All the way!!</p>
	<p>Binging on mangas, novels, anime, tv series, and movies is my hobby.</p>
	<p>When I was little, I used to aspire to be a doctor AND a lawyer. Yup. I did. Good thing I stopped.</p>
